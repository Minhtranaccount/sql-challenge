# sql-challenge

This research project is about creating an analysis of people whom the company employed during the 1980s and 1990s. All that remains of the employee database from that period are six CSV files.

The six CSV files are:
<ul>
  <li>departments <li>
  <li>dept_emp <li>
<li>dept_manager <li>
<li>employees <li>
<li>salaries <li>
<li>titles<li>
</ul>


For this project, I have designed the tables to hold the data from the CSV files, imported the CSV files into a SQL database, and then answered questions about the data. 

It includes three main tasks:
- Data Modelling: creating ERD of 6 tables.
- Data Engineering: adding a table schema in PostgreSQL.
- Data Analysis: retrieving and analysing data from different tables.
