# sql-challenge

This research project is about creating an analysis of human resources whom the company employed during a period of time.

For this project, I have designed the tables to hold the data from the CSV files, imported the CSV files into a SQL database, and then answered questions about the data. 

It includes three main tasks:
- Data Modelling: creating ERD of 6 tables.
 <ul>
  <li> departments 
  <li>dept_emp 
<li>dept_manager 
<li>employees 
<li>salaries 
<li>titles
</ul>
- Data Engineering: adding a table schema in PostgreSQL.
- Data Analysis: retrieving and analysing data from different tables.
